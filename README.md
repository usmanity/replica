# replica ðŸ¦œ
This project consists of different homepages that I'm trying to replicate, mostly to practice my front-end skills and
hopefully to learn something about how these pages are made.


All logos are owned by the respective companies, they are not owned by me, they're just used to mimic the homepage.

Fonts are downloaded or referenced when available, all are freely available on the internet and if you'd like a font usage
removed from a replica page, please let me know.

If you would like to get your logo or font removed, please just contact me by emailing contact@mhmd.us or by opening
a pull request.

## Forking, making your own, using the template
Feel free to fork and make your own replicas, the template folder contains the basic setup, I use the `replicate` file to copy it by running `./replicate <project name>` and it creates a folder containing the files, nothing fancy is happening, just a simple folder creation and copying the files there.
